To upgrade bootstrap, go here:

    http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/index.html

and download the latest version.

Extract the following files:

    app/assets/javascripts/bootstrap/bootstrap.js
    app/assets/stylesheets/bootstrap/bootstrap.scss.css  (note the .scss.css extension)
    app/assets/images/bootstrap/glyphicons-halflings-white.png
    app/assets/images/bootstrap/glyphicons-halflings.png

Now modify app/assets/stylesheets/bootstrap.scss.css...

Find any url references to:

    glyphicons-halflings.png

and make sure they looks like this:

    url(image_path("bootstrap/glyphicons-halflings.png"))

And do the same thing for:

    glyphicons-halflings-white.png

make sure they looks like this:

    url(image_path("bootstrap/glyphicons-halflings-white.png"))

Then you are done.  Unless the new version of bootstrap is way different,
in which case, good luck!  (Get ready to get intimate with Firebug)
